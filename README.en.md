## Final App Project from Programming Web and Mobile Course (Distance Learning) from the Instituto Federal de EducaÃ§Ã£o, CiÃªncia e Tecnologia de SÃ£o Paulo - IFSP

The personal book collection application is for you to organize the books you are currently reading. Similar to a bookmark, however the application offers you a more sophisticated form of organization, showing the percentage of what has already been read and an image of the book registered in the list.
